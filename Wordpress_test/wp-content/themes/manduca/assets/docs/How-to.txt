How to ...



... add new svg icons.
      Use filter 'manduca_svg_icons' Input parameter is Manduca svg icons, and you can extend it with yours.
      
... change breadcrumb parameters
      - copy breadcrumb-template file to the child theme's template-parts/header directory and change the parameters in it.
      - or - if you are familiar with PHP programming: extend the breadcrumb class.
      
... add namespace in child theme in order to avoid nam confusions::
      add the namesepace as a key to Manduca_Classloader. e.g 'Web25\\childtheme' => get_stylesheet_directory() .'/inc/'

... use Collapsable Paragraph (accessible multi-level hide-show system) page template
      - use <h2></h2> elements for titles of collapsable paragraph.
      - Before first (h2) is not collapsable.

... implement multi-level hide-show system on posts and other contents.
            You can use in #wrapper (that is #primary and #secondary)
            Enque the script. Example: page-templates/accordion.php
            Use the following classes:
            
            *obligatory
            js-to_expandmore  : this is the button (e.g. h2) which is the title of the collapsable part.
            js-to_expand      : this is the hide/show part (div)
            Elements that have expandmore and to_expand classes must be adjacent.   
            
            *optional
            js-expandmore-all : this is a button to hide all and show all. 
            is-opened         : part is visible when page has been loaded
            Use keys: space or enter to hide/show,
            Use escape to hide actual part.

... Add homepage navmenu item: Add http://home-placement to the menu item.
